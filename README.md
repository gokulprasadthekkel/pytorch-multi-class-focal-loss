# pytorch-multi-class-focal-loss

An implementation of multi-class focal loss in pytorch.<br>

Focal loss,originally developed for handling extreme foreground-background class imbalance in object detection algorithms, could be used as an alternative for cross-entropy loss when you have imbalanced datasets.
